WEB RTC
Refer to Video = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FExZvpVvYxA

Stands for Web Real-Time Communication
Peer-To-Peer
Enables rich media communication
NAT
Stands for Network Address Translation
It basically is a way of translation of local network IP addresses to a single IP address.
Example = Our router has got a public IP address . So , when we make a request to any website in that case our router translates our local-IP address (let’s say it’s 10.0.0.1) and converts it to our public IP while retaining the info of the local IP as it will need to send back the information to the requesting computer.
NAT Translation Methods
One To One NAT ( Full-cone NAT)
Address Restricted NAT
Port Restricted NAT
Symmetric NAT ( web RTC doesn’t work with this and for most of the time the above mentioned ones are only used)
One To One NAT ( Full-cone NAT)
It basically means that whenever a packet is sent to the router it will always relay it to the user without checking/caring about the origin of the packet.
Address Restricted NAT
It basically means that Router will only allow signals from those IP addresses (regardless of port) with whom it has communicated before ( that means who it trusts).
Port Restricted NAT
It’s exactly like Address Restricted NAT but it also takes port in consideration.
STUN
Stands for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
It basically is used to tell the user about it’s public IP Address:port/ public presence through NAT.
Basically it returns a packet as a response which contains our public IP:port.
Apart from Symmetric NAT , it works for the remaining three of them.
Usually it’s present on port 3478.
TURN
Stands for Traversal Using Relays Around NAT.
Used in the case of Symmetric NAT.
It’s basically just a server that relays packets . Meaning it Just acts as a medium of communication between two devices (i.e. It’s not Peer-To-Peer anymore).
ICE
Stands for Interactive Connectivity Establishment.
ICE candidates = Local IP Addresses , Reflexive Addresses(STUN) , Relayed Addresses(TURN).
It’s Job is to basically collect all information (Like how communication etc is gonna be established) and store it in SDP.
SDP
Stands for Session Description Protocol.
It’s not actually a protocol but in fact it’s just a format that describes ICE candidates , networking options , media options , security options and other stuff.
We Somehow need to send it to the user with which we are trying to connect , the method of transmission doesn’t matter.
SDP Signaling
Signaling basically stands for conveying the information.
It doesn’t matter how we send it.
IRL - WebSocket is basically used for sending purposes.
